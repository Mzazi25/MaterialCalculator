An android app built using Kotlin that consumes [Rick And Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation) to display list of characters.
It has been built following Architecture Principle, Repository Pattern, MVVM Architecture in the presentation layer as well as jetpack components.
### Prerequisites

## ðŸ›  Built With

- - [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) - Kotlin is a programming language that can run on JVM. Google has announced Kotlin as one of its officially supported programming languages in Android Studio; and the Android community is migrating at a pace from Java to Kotlin.

- CI/CD:
    - [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io/) -Bitrise makes it easy to automate all your software workflows. Build, test, and deploy your code with Bitrise. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.
